### Option 1: Docker (Recommended for Production)

The easiest way to run the monitor is using Docker:

#### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed ([Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))

#### Quick Start
1. **Configure your settings:**
   ```bash
   # Edit config.py and add your Telegram credentials
   nano config.py
   ```

2. **Build and run with Docker Compose:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Check logs:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f btc-monitor
   ```

4. **Stop the monitor:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

#### Docker Commands

```bash
# Build the image
docker-compose build

# Start the monitor (detached mode)
docker-compose up -d

# View logs in real-time
docker-compose logs -f

# Restart the monitor
docker-compose restart

# Stop the monitor
docker-compose stop

# Remove container and volumes
docker-compose down -v
```

### Option 2: Manual Python Installation

#### 1. Install required libraries

Open terminal/command prompt and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually:

```bash
pip install requests pandas numpy python-telegram-bot
```

#### 2. Download files

Place the following files in the same folder:
- `monitor_btc.py` (main file)
- `config.py` (configuration)
- `requirements.txt` (dependencies)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Basic Configuration

Edit `config.py` file to adjust your strategy:

```python
MIN_DROP = 5.0              # Alert when price drops 5% in 24h
MA_DISTANCE = 3.0           # Alert when price is 3% below average
RSI_OVERSOLD = 30           # RSI below 30 = oversold
MA_PERIOD = 7               # 7-day moving average
STOP_LOSS = 3.0             # 3% stop loss
TAKE_PROFIT = 2.0           # Minimum 2% target
CHECK_INTERVAL = 300        # Check every 5 minutes
```

### Telegram Setup (Optional but Recommended)

To receive notifications on your phone:

1. **Create a Telegram Bot:**
   - Open Telegram and search for `@BotFather`
   - Send `/newbot` command
   - Follow instructions and choose a name for your bot
   - Save the **bot token** (looks like: `123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz`)

2. **Get your Chat ID:**
   - Send a message to your bot
   - Open this URL in your browser (replace TOKEN with your bot token):
     ```
     https://api.telegram.org/botTOKEN/getUpdates
     ```
   - Look for `"chat":{"id":123456789}` in the response
   - Save this **chat ID** number

3. **Configure in config.py:**
   ```python
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = "123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz"
   TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID = "123456789"
   TELEGRAM_ENABLED = True
   ```

| RSI Oversold | 2 | RSI indicates oversold |

**‚úÖ ENTRY SIGNAL:** When score reaches 3+ points

## üìÅ Generated Files

### `signals_log.json`

All entry signals are automatically saved to this file:

```json
[
  {
    "timestamp": "2025-10-20 15:30:45",
    "price": 590234.0,
    "signals": [...],
    "entry_signal": true,
    "target_price": 600000.0,
    "stop_loss": 572527.0,
    "score": 5
  }
]
```

## üéì Usage Tips

### Customization by Profile

**Conservative:**
```python
MIN_DROP = 7.0
TAKE_PROFIT = 1.5
STOP_LOSS = 2.0
```

**Moderate (default):**
```python
MIN_DROP = 5.0
TAKE_PROFIT = 2.0
STOP_LOSS = 3.0
```

**Aggressive:**
```python
MIN_DROP = 3.0
TAKE_PROFIT = 3.0
STOP_LOSS = 4.0
```

### Recommended Time Windows

- **Morning (9am-12pm):** Higher volatility, more opportunities
- **Afternoon (2pm-5pm):** Calmer movements
- **Night (8pm-11pm):** US market influence

### Manual Backtesting

You can analyze historical data by editing the date in the code:

```python
# In monitor_btc.py file, around line 200
# Change to analyze a specific date
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Error: "No module named 'requests'"
```bash
pip install requests
```

### Error: "No module named 'telegram'"
```bash
pip install python-telegram-bot
```

### Error: "Connection timeout"
- Check your internet connection
- Binance API might be temporarily unavailable

### Telegram notifications not working
- Verify bot token is correct
- Check chat ID is correct
- Ensure you sent at least one message to your bot
- Verify `TELEGRAM_ENABLED = True` in config.py

### Too many false alerts
- Increase `MIN_DROP` in config.py
- Increase minimum score for entry (edit line 277 in the code)

### Too few alerts
- Decrease `MIN_DROP`
- Decrease `CHECK_INTERVAL` to check more frequently

### Docker Issues

**Container not starting:**
```bash
# Check container status
docker-compose ps

# View detailed logs
docker-compose logs btc-monitor
```

**Config changes not taking effect:**
```bash
# Restart the container after editing config.py
docker-compose restart
```

**Container keeps restarting:**
```bash
# Check if config.py has valid Telegram credentials
# View logs for error messages
docker-compose logs -f btc-monitor
```

**Update the application:**
```bash
# Rebuild the Docker image
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```
